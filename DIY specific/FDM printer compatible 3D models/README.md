# FDM printer compatible versions of the TOHKBD casings
## Keyboard casing
The keyboard casing was split in to two objects to get rid of the overhanging parts. Note that the original magnets that came with the DIY kit probably do not fit the magnet holes any more as it is now designed for a bit smaller diameter magnets.

## TOH casing
The alignment bumps were removed from the casing that attaches to the phone and the long side walls were made thinner to not cover the power and volume rocker buttons as much as the original model.
