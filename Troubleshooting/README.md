# Troubleshooting

## Regular mode of operation

Connect Cover to phone. Phone should read EEPROM to check if driver is already installed, if not it will pull it from the store with the ID found on the NFC tag. Connecte the keyboard, it should say 'keyboard connected' as a notification. You are ready to rock and roll now!

At this moment, the NFC tag is NOT linked to the store, so it will say 'This OtherHalf does not work'. This does not mean it is broken, it just can't find the driver. You can fix this by waiting untill it is linked, or install it yourself from [Kimmo's Github](https://github.com/kimmoli/tohkbd2).
